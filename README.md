##An animated delaunay triangulation
Web playground based on HTML,CSS and JS, mostly experimenting with Canvas
Trying to implement a solution for real time Delaunay triangulation using the divide and conquer approach.
Time complexity should be O(nlog(n)) + O(n*vÂ²) : n the number of points and v the max number of edge of a point.
-Triangulation is working in real time with colors, unfortunately there are still unresolved problems, resulting in some wrong triangulation.
